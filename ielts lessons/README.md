## IELTS prep
This folder contains many books that were utilised to help Uzbek learners prepare for IETLS exam.

#### Listening exercises
Here exist files - transcripts of audios with some words intentionally absent and to be filled by students. The audios themselves can be share upon request.
#### BBC questions.pdf
This file includes comprehension and vocabulary questions to monitor students learning through BBC World Service podcasts.
#### Monk comprehension questions and vocabulary .pdf
This is a fascinating project which was unfrotunately discountinued as I left IELTS prep. It includes comprehension and vocabulary questions to monitor students learning through binge-watching (Teleseries "Adrian Monk" in this case)
#### oxford union questions.pdf
This file includes comprehension and vocabulary questions to monitor students learning through Oxford Union Debate. As expected it is rather advanced.
#### compass.pdf
This file compiles many reading passages readily available but dispersed throuhgout internet - to facilitate students focusing and learning from a single source while getting to English level expected by IELTS
#### readbook.pdf
This file contains passages to be used simultaneously with "checkbook.pdf". The idea behind is to distribute readbook passages to students as homework and monitor their learning through checkbook.
#### checkbook.pdf
This file is to be used concurrently with readbook.pdf
#### easy writing.pdf
This file and "learn how to play the essay" are books to be distributed by a teacher using Ryan Higgins' 'IETLS Academic Writing' books. Because in Uzbekistan student cannot usually afford buying Ryan Higgins' books, these files include most important parts of the book that cannot be delivered by a teacher.
#### learn how to play the essay.pdf
This file is adjacent to 'easy writing.pdf'
#### speakbook.pdf
This file is a compressed version of Jeremy Chiron's book on IELTS speaking. The reasoning behind making such a book is similar to that of 'easy writing.pdf'
